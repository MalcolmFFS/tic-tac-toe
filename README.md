# tic-tac-toe
Just a python based, tty tic-tac-toe game.

The game is scalable and will make a board of a size submitted by the user.
The win condition is a minimal of 3 sequential marks for smaller board sizes. For larger board sizes, the win condition is half the size given by the user, or half the size + 1 if the number given is odd.
